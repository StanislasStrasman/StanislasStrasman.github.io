I am a third-year PhD student in **Applied Probability** and **Machine Learning** at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/), within the [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/) laboratory, under the supervision of [Claire Boyer](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~claire.boyer/) (Université Paris-Saclay), [Sylvain Le Corff](https://sylvainlc.github.io/) (Sorbonne Université), [Vincent Lemaire](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~vlemaire/site.html) (Sorbonne Université) and [Antonio Ocello](https://antonio-ocello.github.io/#) (ENSAE Paris / CREST). My PhD is funded by the [Institut des Sciences du Calcul et des Données](https://iscd.sorbonne-universite.fr/about/). 

My research focuses on **Score-based Generative Models (SGMs)** — also known as *diffusion models* — with a particular interest in developing theoretical analyses that yield algorithmic insights.

# Short Bio

Before starting my PhD, I completed graduate studies in the social sciences — specialized in economics — where I developed a strong interest in the mathematical foundations of modeling uncertainty. This curiosity led me to pursue further training in **probability theory, statistics, and machine learning**, eventually leading to my current PhD on **diffusion models**.  

# Research Interests
- Score-based and diffusion generative models  
- Sequential Monte Carlo and posterior inference  
- Theoretical aspects of machine learning and generative AI
